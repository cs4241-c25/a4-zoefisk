Assignment A4 - Web Component Framework
===

Due: Monday, February 17th, by 11:59 AM.

For this assignment you will re-implement Assignment A3 using React components, a style framework, MongoDB, and either 
1. the React framework, Express, and Passport GitHub authentication, or
2. the NextJS framework with NextAuth for authentication
Please keep in mind that implementing authentication is challenging and can be frustrating to debug. Please start this
assignment early! You may deploy this project on any hosting service (Glitch, DigitalOcean, Heroku etc.).
However, make sure to push your final application to your assignment GitHub repo so the course staff can review the code.
