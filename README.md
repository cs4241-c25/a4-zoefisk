I have pretty much completely changed the look of my website from a3, I feel like it is much better than how it used to
look now that I am using better styling. I used Mantine components to style my website, which I think really pull it all
together very nicely. Overall, I think my website is significantly more polished as well. While there are some minor
issues, like not looking good on mobile (especially on the home page), I'm very satisfied with the progress that I
made. In the a4 version of my site, there are a lot more features and things than in the a3 version. For example,
I added Unsplash API, so that users can search for images and set them as their background, which saves to the database
so their choice of image is there the next time that they sign in. Also, in addition to Github authentication, I also
added Google authentication. In addition to signing in and out, I added the ability to delete your account, which
removes all tasks from the database as well as removing the user's background image, if they chose their own. At this time,
it technically does not actually remove their account from Github or Google, so this is something that I would have added
if I had more time. However, on the user's end, it is hard to immediately tell that their account wasn't actually deleted.
Another small addition was that when a user signs in for the first time, it generates a username based on their email
address, and this username is displayed at the top of their to-do list. Finally, I added a button in the settings menu
that allows users to export their tasks as a CSV file.
